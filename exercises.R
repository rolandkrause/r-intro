# Exercise 1
# Create a vector of the letters A, B and C.

# Assign the vector to a the variable my_letters

# Check the what happens when you run letters (just this) on the command line.

# What happens when you concatenate two vectors? Add c(my_letters , my_letters)

# Add the number 1 to letters. What happens to the type of the vector


# Exercise 2

# 1. Create a vector my_vec with the numbers from 1 through 8.
# 2. Apply the operation `+2` to the vector/
# 3. Add the vector containing 1, 2, 3, 4 to my_vec. What do you observe?


# Exercise 3


#  Consider the R output of the matrix below:

  # [,1] [,2]
  # [1,]    4    1
  # [2,]    9    5
  # [3,]   10    7

  # 1. What was one of the correct commands used to write this matrix?
  #
  # 2. Assign the matrix as `A`
  #
  # 3. Check the dimensions
  #
  # 4. Extract the element `5`
  #
  # 5. Add the vector `c(0,0,0)` as a new column and update `A`
  #
  # 6. Modify the element 4 to `0`
  #
  # 7. Compute the transpose of `A`


  # Create a function that sums up two values even if provided as characters values

  # Test the function

# Exercise 4

# Do not write a for loop

# Exercise 5

# Create a function that returns the mean, median and standard deviation


# Exercise 6
# Create a pipe statement that counts the number of NAs in vector.
# The output of c('1' , "a", NA, "2", NA) should be 2.
